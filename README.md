## About
A productivity app meant to help users organize their notes, to-dos, reminders, and flashcard decks. Its unique feature is giving users the option to send reminders and flashcards as text messages. The app was build using React, Sequelize, and Bootstrap.

## Features
What users can do:
* Create and login into their account
* Type and save notes, which can also be deleted. Bolding, italicizing, underlining, indenting, embedding links, and image upload are included in the toolbar.
* Make decks of flashcards. Decks may have tags tied to them so users can use the search bar to filter out what decks they want to see. Users have the option to set their decks to be private or public. If set to public, unregistered users can search these decks from the landing page. When registered users choose a deck, they can create flashcards. They can also send these decks as text messages that act like quizzes.
* Create reminders about events that they can refer to. Users can also customize what day and time to send the reminder as a text message.
* Create a list of tasks and each task can be checked off.
